#   How did you implements comments to blog posts?

I started off getting myself a free account on disqus.com. I decided on oskarlovsveden as my shortname/website name.

In the ``_includes`` folder under ``disqus_comments.html`` I replaced the code with this, which was found at disqus.com:

{% highlight html %}
<div id="disqus_thread"></div>
<script>

(function() {
var d = document, s = d.createElement('script');
s.src = 'https://{{site.disqus.shortname}}.disqus.com/embed.js';
s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date());
(d.head || d.body).appendChild(s);
})();
</script>
<noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the 
    <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a>
</noscript>
{% endhighlight %}

After this all that was left to do was tell my ``_config.yml`` that ``shortname: oskarlovsveden`` and add ``comments: true`` to the posts I want to have comments available.
