#   What is humans.txt and how have you configure it for your site?

It's an intiative made with the intention of knowing the people who are responsible for the creation of the site.
Because of it being a .txt-file it doesn't intrude with the code.

I used it to provide some short info about myself, a not so serious thanks-section dedicated to Jekyll and my cats and also some short info on the site and tools used.
