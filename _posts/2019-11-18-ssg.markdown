#   What do you think of static site generators?
They are really nice in the way that you don't have to start from scratch. Working with templates really helps to get productivity up.

1.  What type of projects are they suitable for?
    Projects like these, blogs and other sources of information. I'm sure many apps on mobile phones would benefit from these tools if you just want a "plain" website for logging in to a service and getting some basic information.
