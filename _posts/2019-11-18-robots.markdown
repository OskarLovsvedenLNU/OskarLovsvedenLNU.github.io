#   What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?
``robots.txt`` is a textfile in the rootfolder. It tells the many search-engines how they are allowed to crawl.

1.  All search-engines have free access to the contents of your website.
2.  Many request this file and if it does not exist it can cause an unnecessary burden on the performance of your site.

It's almost always a good idea to have this file on your site, even if it is empty.

{% highlight plain text %}
#   robots.txt
#   Blocking all search-engines on the entire site
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
{% endhighlight %}

I used this feature to block the entire site from all search-engines.
