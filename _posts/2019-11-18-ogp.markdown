*What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?

It enables any web page to be treated as a graph object. It is mainly used to make sure you can preview your website in a very scaled down way.
It makes for a richer representation. We can manage this by adding the the following ``<meta>`` tags to the ``<head>`` of the web page.

In the ``_includes`` folder under ``head.html`` I added the following:

{% highlight html %}
<meta content="{{site.title}}" property="og:title">
<meta content="web page" property="og:type">
<meta content="https://OskarLovsvedenLNU.github.io/pokeman.png" property="og:image">
<meta content="https://OskarLovsvedenLNU.github.io" property="og:url">
{% endhighlight %}
