# Hello,

My name is Oskar LÃ¶vsveden and I study Web-programming at Linnaeus University. I live in Kalmar with my girlfriend and two cats. Before starting up my studies, I spent a long working in a warhouse and felt I needed to do something else going forward.

In my spare time I enjoy gaming on the PC and consoles such as the Nintendo Switch.
