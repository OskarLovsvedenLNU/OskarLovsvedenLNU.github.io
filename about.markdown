# Hello,

My name is Oskar Lövsveden and I study Web-programming at Linnaeus University. I live in Kalmar with my girlfriend and two cats. Before starting up my studies, I spent a long working in a warhouse and felt I needed to do something else going forward.

I feel like i already learned alot from the time in school so far, and I'm hoping to just keep it going at the same pace.

In my spare time I ***love*** gaming on the PC and consoles such as the Nintendo Switch.
Some of the games I play are:

- League of Legends
- Pokémon
- World of Warcraft
